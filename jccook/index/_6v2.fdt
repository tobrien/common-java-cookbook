Perhaps he loves you now,And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirchThe virtue of his will: but you must fear,His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;For he himself is subject to his birth:He may not, as unvalued persons do,Carve for himself; for on his choice dependsThe safety and health of this whole state;And therefore must his choice be circumscribedUnto the voice and yielding of that bodyWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,It fits your wisdom so far to believe itAs he in his particular act and placeMay give his saying deed; which is no furtherThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,If with too credent ear you list his songs,Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure openTo his unmaster'd importunity.Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,And keep you in the rear of your affection,Out of the shot and danger of desire.The chariest maid is prodigal enough,If she unmask her beauty to the moon:Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:The canker galls the infants of the spring,Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,And in the morn and liquid dew of youthContagious blastments are most imminent.Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.LAERTES&SCENE III.

Give thy thoughts no tongue,Nor any unproportioned thought his act.Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;But do not dull thy palm with entertainmentOf each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. BewareOf entrance to a quarrel, but being in,Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;For the apparel oft proclaims the man,And they in France of the best rank and stationAre of a most select and generous chief in that.Neither a borrower nor a lender be;For loan oft loses both itself and friend,And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.This above all: to thine ownself be true,And it must follow, as the night the day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

About, my brain!

Nay, do not think I flatter;For what advancement may I hope from theeThat no revenue hast but thy good spirits,To feed and clothe thee?

Dost thou hear?Since my dear soul was mistress of her choiceAnd could of men distinguish, her electionHath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast beenAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,A man that fortune's buffets and rewardsHast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are thoseWhose blood and judgment are so well commingled,That they are not a pipe for fortune's fingerTo sound what stop she please. Give me that manThat is not passion's slave, and I will wear himIn my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--There is a play to-night before the king;One scene of it comes near the circumstanceWhich I have told thee of my father's death:I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,Even with the very comment of thy soulObserve mine uncle: if his occulted guiltDo not itself unkennel in one speech,It is a damned ghost that we have seen,And my imaginations are as foulAs Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,And after we will both our judgments joinIn censure of his seeming.HAMLET SCENE II.

Pray can I not,Though inclination be as sharp as will:My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;And, like a man to double business bound,I stand in pause where I shall first begin,And both neglect. What if this cursed handWere thicker than itself with brother's blood,Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavensTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercyBut to confront the visage of offence?And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,To be forestalled ere we come to fall,Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayerCan serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?That cannot be; since I am still possess'dOf those effects for which I did the murder,My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?In the corrupted currents of this worldOffence's gilded hand may shove by justice,And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itselfBuys out the law: but 'tis not so above;There is no shuffling, there the action liesIn his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,To give in evidence. What then? what rests?Try what repentance can: what can it not?Yet what can it when one can not repent?O wretched state! O bosom black as death!O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!All may be well.

There is no barTo make against your highness' claim to FranceBut this, which they produce from Pharamond,'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:''No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'Which Salique land the French unjustly glozeTo be the realm of France, and PharamondThe founder of this law and female bar.Yet their own authors faithfully affirmThat the land Salique is in Germany,Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,There left behind and settled certain French;Who, holding in disdain the German womenFor some dishonest manners of their life,Establish'd then this law; to wit, no femaleShould be inheritrix in Salique land:Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.Then doth it well appear that Salique lawWas not devised for the realm of France:Nor did the French possess the Salique landUntil four hundred one and twenty yearsAfter defunction of King Pharamond,Idly supposed the founder of this law;Who died within the year of our redemptionFour hundred twenty-six; and Charles the GreatSubdued the Saxons, and did seat the FrenchBeyond the river Sala, in the yearEight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,Did, as heir general, being descendedOf Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,Make claim and title to the crown of France.Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crownOf Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir maleOf the true line and stock of Charles the Great,To find his title with some shows of truth,'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,Daughter to Charlemain, who was the sonTo Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the sonOf Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,Could not keep quiet in his conscience,Wearing the crown of France, till satisfiedThat fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:By the which marriage the line of Charles the GreatWas re-united to the crown of France.So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,King Lewis his satisfaction, all appearTo hold in right and title of the female:So do the kings of France unto this day;Howbeit they would hold up this Salique lawTo bar your highness claiming from the female,And rather choose to hide them in a netThan amply to imbar their crooked titlesUsurp'd from you and your progenitors.

The Presence chamber.ACT IThe Life of Henry the FifthﬂTherefore doth heaven divideThe state of man in divers functions,Setting endeavour in continual motion;To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,Creatures that by a rule in nature teachThe act of order to a peopled kingdom.They have a king and officers of sorts;Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,Which pillage they with merry march bring homeTo the tent-royal of their emperor;Who, busied in his majesty, surveysThe singing masons building roofs of gold,The civil citizens kneading up the honey,The poor mechanic porters crowding inTheir heavy burdens at his narrow gate,The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,Delivering o'er to executors paleThe lazy yawning drone. I this infer,That many things, having full referenceTo one consent, may work contrariously:As many arrows, loosed several ways,Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;As many lines close in the dial's centre;So may a thousand actions, once afoot.End in one purpose, and be all well borneWithout defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.Divide your happy England into four;Whereof take you one quarter into France,And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.If we, with thrice such powers left at home,Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,Let us be worried and our nation loseThe name of hardiness and policy.

We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;His present and your pains we thank you for:When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,We will, in France, by God's grace, play a setShall strike his father's crown into the hazard.Tell him he hath made a match with such a wranglerThat all the courts of France will be disturb'dWith chaces. And we understand him well,How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,Not measuring what use we made of them.We never valued this poor seat of England;And therefore, living hence, did give ourselfTo barbarous licence; as 'tis ever commonThat men are merriest when they are from home.But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,Be like a king and show my sail of greatnessWhen I do rouse me in my throne of France:For that I have laid by my majestyAnd plodded like a man for working-days,But I will rise there with so full a gloryThat I will dazzle all the eyes of France,Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.And tell the pleasant prince this mock of hisHath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soulShall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeanceThat shall fly with them: for many a thousand widowsShall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;And some are yet ungotten and unbornThat shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.But this lies all within the will of God,To whom I do appeal; and in whose nameTell you the Dauphin I am coming on,To venge me as I may and to put forthMy rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.So get you hence in peace; and tell the DauphinHis jest will savour but of shallow wit,When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.Convey them with safe conduct.

Now all the youth of England are on fire,And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thoughtReigns solely in the breast of every man:They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,Following the mirror of all Christian kings,With winged heels, as English Mercuries.For now sits Expectation in the air,And hides a sword from hilts unto the pointWith crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,Promised to Harry and his followers.The French, advised by good intelligenceOf this most dreadful preparation,Shake in their fear and with pale policySeek to divert the English purposes.O England! model to thy inward greatness,Like little body with a mighty heart,What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,Were all thy children kind and natural!But see thy fault! France hath in thee found outA nest of hollow bosoms, which he fillsWith treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;And by their hands this grace of kings must die,If hell and treason hold their promises,Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.Linger your patience on; and we'll digestThe abuse of distance; force a play:The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;The king is set from London; and the sceneIs now transported, gentles, to Southampton;There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:And thence to France shall we convey you safe,And bring you back, charming the narrow seasTo give you gentle pass; for, if we may,We'll not offend one stomach with our play.But, till the king come forth, and not till then,Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.ChorusPROLOGUEACT IIThe Life of Henry the FifthWell met, Corporal Nym.BARDOLPHSCENE I.

'tis so strange,That, though the truth of it stands off as grossAs black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.Treason and murder ever kept together,As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,Working so grossly in a natural cause,That admiration did not whoop at them:But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring inWonder to wait on treason and on murder:And whatsoever cunning fiend it wasThat wrought upon thee so preposterouslyHath got the voice in hell for excellence:All other devils that suggest by treasonsDo botch and bungle up damnationWith patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'dFrom glistering semblances of piety;But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thusShould with his lion gait walk the whole world,He might return to vasty Tartar back,And tell the legions 'I can never winA soul so easy as that Englishman's.'O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infectedThe sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,Not working with the eye without the ear,And but in purged judgment trusting neither?Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,To mark the full-fraught man and best induedWith some suspicion.

As young as I am, I have observed these threeswashers.

For Bardolph, he is white-livered andred-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, butfights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongueand a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breakswords, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hathheard that men of few words are the best men; andtherefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'should be thought a coward: but his few bad wordsare matched with as few good deeds; for a' neverbroke any man's head but his own, and that wasagainst a post when he was drunk. They will stealany thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole alute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it forthree half pence. Nym and Bardolph are swornbrothers in filching, and in Calais they stole afire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service themen would carry coals. They would have me asfamiliar with men's pockets as their gloves or theirhandkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,if I should take from another's pocket to put intomine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs.

I am afeard there are few diewell that die in a battle; for how can theycharitably dispose of any thing, when blood is theirargument?

Besides, there is noking, be his cause never so spotless, if it come tothe arbitrement of swords, can try it out with allunspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on themthe guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals ofperjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, thathave before gored the gentle bosom of peace withpillage and robbery. Now, if these men havedefeated the law and outrun native punishment,though they can outstrip men, they have no wings tofly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;so that here men are punished for before-breach ofthe king's laws in now the king's quarrel: wherethey feared the death, they have borne life away;and where they would be safe, they perish: then ifthey die unprovided, no more is the king guilty oftheir damnation than he was before guilty of thoseimpieties for the which they are now visited.

O, be sick, great greatness,And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!Think'st thou the fiery fever will go outWith titles blown from adulation?Will it give place to flexure and low bending?Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;I am a king that find thee, and I know'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,The farced title running 'fore the king,The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pompThat beats upon the high shore of this world,No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,Not all these, laid in bed majestical,Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,Who with a body fill'd and vacant mindGets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,But, like a lackey, from the rise to setSweats in the eye of Phoebus and all nightSleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,And follows so the ever-running year,With profitable labour, to his grave:And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.The slave, a member of the country's peace,Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wotsWhat watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,Whose hours the peasant best advantages.KING HENRY V(SCENE I.

And while thoulivest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain anduncoined constancy; for he perforce must do theeright, because he hath not the gift to woo in otherplaces: for these fellows of infinite tongue, thatcan rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they doalways reason themselves out again.

Agood leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; ablack beard will turn white; a curled pate will growbald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will waxhollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and themoon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for itshines bright and never changes, but keeps hiscourse truly. If thou would have such a one, takeme; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,take a king.

I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,As well as I do know your outward favour.Well, honour is the subject of my story.I cannot tell what you and other menThink of this life; but, for my single self,I had as lief not be as live to beIn awe of such a thing as I myself.I was born free as Caesar; so were you:We both have fed as well, and we can bothEndure the winter's cold as well as he:For once, upon a raw and gusty day,The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, nowLeap in with me into this angry flood,And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,Accoutred as I was, I plunged inAnd bade him follow; so indeed he did.The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet itWith lusty sinews, throwing it asideAnd stemming it with hearts of controversy;But ere we could arrive the point proposed,Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulderThe old Anchises bear, so from the waves of TiberDid I the tired Caesar. And this manIs now become a god, and Cassius isA wretched creature and must bend his body,If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.He had a fever when he was in Spain,And when the fit was on him, I did markHow he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;His coward lips did from their colour fly,And that same eye whose bend doth awe the worldDid lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the RomansMark him and write his speeches in their books,Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'As a sick girl.

Age, thou art shamed!Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!When went there by an age, since the great flood,But it was famed with more than with one man?When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,When there is in it but one only man.O, you and I have heard our fathers say,There was a Brutus once that would have brook'dThe eternal devil to keep his state in RomeAs easily as a king.CASSIUSSCENE II.

Marry, this well carried shall on her behalfChange slander to remorse; that is some good:But not for that dream I on this strange course,But on this travail look for greater birth.She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,Upon the instant that she was accused,Shall be lamented, pitied and excusedOf every hearer: for it so falls outThat what we have we prize not to the worthWhiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,Why, then we rack the value, then we findThe virtue that possession would not show usWhiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:When he shall hear she died upon his words,The idea of her life shall sweetly creepInto his study of imagination,And every lovely organ of her lifeShall come apparell'd in more precious habit,More moving-delicate and full of life,Into the eye and prospect of his soul,Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,If ever love had interest in his liver,And wish he had not so accused her,No, though he thought his accusation true.Let this be so, and doubt not but successWill fashion the event in better shapeThan I can lay it down in likelihood.But if all aim but this be levell'd false,The supposition of the lady's deathWill quench the wonder of her infamy:And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,As best befits her wounded reputation,In some reclusive and religious life,Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.

The blind mole castsCopp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'dBy man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law'stheir will;And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?It is enough you know; and it is fit,What being more known grows worse, to smother it.All love the womb that their first being bred,Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.PERICLES(SCENE I.

The sum of this,Brought hither to Pentapolis,Y-ravished the regions round,And every one with claps can sound,'Our heir-apparent is a king!Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:His queen with child makes her desire--Which who shall cross?--along to go:Omit we all their dole and woe:Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,And so to sea. Their vessel shakesOn Neptune's billow; half the floodHath their keel cut: but fortune's moodVaries again; the grisly northDisgorges such a tempest forth,That, as a duck for life that dives,So up and down the poor ship drives:The lady shrieks, and well-a-nearDoes fall in travail with her fear:And what ensues in this fell stormShall for itself itself perform.I nill relate, action mayConveniently the rest convey;Which might not what by me is told.In your imagination holdThis stage the ship, upon whose deckThe sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.GOWER

But, alack,That monster envy, oft the wrackOf earned praise, Marina's lifeSeeks to take off by treason's knife.And in this kind hath our CleonOne daughter, and a wench full grown,Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maidHight Philoten: and it is saidFor certain in our story, sheWould ever with Marina be:Be't when she weaved the sleided silkWith fingers long, small, white as milk;Or when she would with sharp needle woundThe cambric, which she made more soundBy hurting it; or when to the luteShe sung, and made the night-bird mute,That still records with moan; or whenShe would with rich and constant penVail to her mistress Dian; stillThis Philoten contends in skillWith absolute Marina: soWith the dove of Paphos might the crowVie feathers white. Marina getsAll praises, which are paid as debts,And not as given. This so darksIn Philoten all graceful marks,That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,A present murderer does prepareFor good Marina, that her daughterMight stand peerless by this slaughter.The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:And cursed Dionyza hathThe pregnant instrument of wrathPrest for this blow.

I do beseech youTo learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,The stages of our story.

Bear you it in mind,Old Helicanus goes along behind.Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have broughtThis king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.See how belief may suffer by foul show!This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,With sighs shot through, and biggest tearso'ershower'd,Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swearsNever to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bearsA tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.The epitaph is for Marina writBy wicked Dionyza.'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,Who wither'd in her spring of year.She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'No visor does become black villanySo well as soft and tender flattery.Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,And bear his courses to be orderedBy Lady Fortune; while our scene must playHis daughter's woe and heavy well-a-dayIn her unholy service.
