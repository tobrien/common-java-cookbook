      <title>Preface</title>
      <para>In this book, you'll find information about a set of
libraries developed within the Jakarta Commons (also referred to as
"Commons"). Commons (<systemitem role="url" moreinfo="none">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons</systemitem>) is a set
of small, popular components from the Apache Software
Foundation's Jakarta project. Ranging from the
elementary to the complex, many would consider some of these
libraries indispensable to any Java© project. These
components are so widespread, they may already be on your classpath.
If you develop an application using Jakarta Struts, Apache Tomcat, or
Hibernate, you have Commons BeanUtils and Commons Logging in your
classpath. If you just installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux with the
default configuration, you've got Commons libraries
somewhere in <filename moreinfo="none">/usr</filename>. If you downloaded
Sun's J2EE 1.4 SDK, you will have also downloaded
Commons Logging and Commons Launcher. While Jakarta Commons may be
everywhere, many are still unaware of the capabilities these
components provide.</para>
      <para>This book uses Jakarta Commons to focus on tactical implementation
details, answering such questions as: How do we parse XML? How do we
serialize beans? Is there an easier way to work with Collections? How
do we work with HTTP and keep track of cookies? The tactical is often
sacrificed for the strategic. Consider a complex J2EE system with a
solid, well-conceived architecture. The strategic (or high-level)
design appears reasonable from 40,000 feet, but as soon as you drill
into the details, you notice that every Servlet or JSP contains pages
upon pages of unmaintainable and unnecessary code because the
developers were not aware of some valuable time-saver like BeanUtils,
Collections, or the Digester. Or, worse, the developer may have spent
a week reimplementing most of the capabilities of Commons BeanUtils
even though BeanUtils was already in the classpath. Knowing what
Jakarta Commons has to offer often helps to inform decisions made at
the lowest level.</para>
      <para>Few application developers would consider writing a custom XML
parser, but developers will frequently write custom components that
duplicate freely available libraries. Take, as an example, a set of
static utility methods that seems to pop up in almost every complex
project. A common process such as reading a file to a
<literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> may be refactored into a
<literal moreinfo="none">CommonFileUtils</literal> class, or turning a DOM
<literal moreinfo="none">Document</literal> into a set of beans may be accomplished
with a set of classes in some custom code. Jakarta Commons provides
solutions to both of these problems and many more, and reading this
book may help you to avoid unnecessary wheel reinvention.</para>
      <para>Many people know of these components in a general sense, but few have
the months or weeks necessary to sit down and read the relevant
tutorials, FAQs, blogs, and archived mailing lists associated with
each component. The amount of work involved in keeping up-to-date
with an array of open source communities is not trivial. This is why
I've tried to compact much of this information into
easily accessible recipes. These recipes were written to provide the
information you need to start using Commons in a few minutes, but the
Discussion and See Also sections give you an opportunity to dig
deeper into the motivation behind each Commons component if you need
more information.</para>
      <para>The tools introduced herein save you serious time and provide you
with a set of alternatives you may not currently be aware of. I wish
I had read a book like this five years ago; it would have accelerated
my learning and helped me to avoid some costly design decisions. Use
this text as you will; if you are only interested in Commons
Collections, you should be able to quickly familiarize yourself with
Collections by browsing <link linkend="jakartackbk-CHP-5">Chapter 5</link>. On the other hand, if
you are looking for a survey of some of the major projects in Jakarta
Commons, read this book from start to finish. Part structured
reference, part prose, the cookbook format lets you customize your
reading experience, and I hope this book is as interesting to read as
it was to write.</para>

         <para>Limited time and resources forced me to make some decisions about
which projects to include in this text. Projects like Velocity,
FreeMarker, and Log4J, while not Commons components, were included
because they fit the mold of a small, easily reusable component.
Other Commons components were not included in this book because they
were still being developed at the time of writing, or because a short
recipe would have been impossible without a detailed 30-page
introduction. Commons DbUtils, DBCP, Discovery, Jelly, Launcher,
Modeler, Pool, Primitives, Chain, and promising sandbox components
could fill another entire volume. Some projects, such as Jakarta
HiveMind, started as components in the Commons Sandbox only to be
promoted directly to subproject status of the Jakarta project.
Classification of projects and components in Jakarta can also be
somewhat arbitrary; Jakarta ORO and Jakarta RegExp would both seem to
be prime candidates for the Jakarta Commons, but they are both
subprojects of Jakarta. Other projects, such as Jakarta Commons
HttpClient, have recently been promoted to be subprojects of Jakarta,
leaving the Commons entirely. Think of this book as focusing on
Jakarta Commons with some other projects thrown in to liven up the
discussion. I apologize in advance if I left your favorite project
out.</para>
         <para>Writing a book about a series of frequently released components is
reminiscent of a game called whack-a-mole. Just when you finish
updating a chapter for a new release, another component has a
release. On average, one commons component is released every one or
two weeks; therefore, a few of the versions in this book may be
obsolete as soon as this book hits the shelves. In general, Jakarta
Commons makes a concerted effort to preserve backward compatibility
and keep a stable public interface. Lessons learned on Commons
BeanUtils 1.6 should remain applicable to Commons BeanUtils 1.7. If
you find that a more recent version of a component has been released,
you should download that more recent version and check the
O'Reilly site for updates related to this book.</para>

         <title>Conventions Used in This Book</title>
         <para>I'll use a number of conventions you should know
about in this book. For example, menu items are separated with
an<symbol role="unicode" remap="8594">→</symbol> like this:
File<symbol role="unicode" remap="8594">→</symbol>
New<symbol role="unicode" remap="8594">→</symbol> Project. To make them
stand out, new lines of code will be displayed highlighted when
they're added. Example code is often presented out
of context; instead of developing an entire class, only the relevant
block of code is presented. Most examples will include the necessary
import statements for Commons-relevant classes, and other
<literal moreinfo="none">import</literal> statements will be implied. When code is
omitted or implied, it will be represented by ellipses:</para>

         <title>The Jakarta Commons Community</title>
         <para>The Jakarta community and the larger community of the Apache Software
Foundation is committed to developing open source software. The
Apache Software Foundation is a nonprofit corporation registered in
Delaware that supports ongoing collaborative software development
according to a set of simple ideals: transparency, meritocracy,
consensus, and mutual respect. To learn more about the foundation,
start at the Frequently Asked Questions page on www.apache.org
(<systemitem role="url" moreinfo="none">http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html</systemitem>).
Jakarta is a project under the Apache Software Foundation, and it is
managed by what is known as a Project Management Committee (PMC).
This committee manages a number of Jakarta subprojects including the
Jakarta Commons.</para>
         <para>The Jakarta community and Apache XML community both had tremendous
growth spurts from 1999 to 2003, with both projects becoming dominant
forces in open source Java. Tomcat, Struts, Xerces, Xalan, Ant,
Cocoon, and other projects were embraced by the larger community and
Java developed a very strong association with open source because of
the influence of Jakarta. Toward the end of this growth spurt, the
corporate structure of Apache required a certain level of oversight
and accountability, which could not be achieved in an umbrella
project like Jakarta with hundreds of committers. A decision was made
to encourage Jakarta subprojects to move toward smaller, more focused
PMCs. One of the first projects to leave Jakarta was Apache Ant, and
other projects such as Maven, Struts, and Log4j followed suit. This
new, more nimble approach to the structure of collaborative software
development avoids the creation of a management layer between project
participants and the PMC. Apache is making way for a new generation
of projects that will set the standard for open source Java,
including Geronimo, Pluto, Directory, Derby, and Axion. Be aware that
the structure of projects and subprojects in Jakarta is somewhat
fluid at the moment, and, as the situation evolves, certain
components could be split off into separate Apache projects.</para>
         <para>If you find the components in this book helpful, I encourage you to
take some time to observe the commons-dev developer mailing list. The
ASF is (mostly) transparent, and this means that the general public
has a window into the collaborative development process that is used
to create a large body of great software. I would encourage any
developer to take an interest in a piece of software and watch the
development process. Follow the decisions, releases, arguments,
flame-wars, and evolution of something like Jakarta Commons and you
can see for yourself what works and what doesn't
work. This is also a great way to keep yourself informed of the
changes and direction of certain projects.</para>
         <para>I don't intend to speak for this community, and,
honestly, no one can speak for a group as diverse as the one that has
formed around Jakarta Commons. I wanted to write this book to help
attract more people to the concept of Jakarta Commons and to take
some time to encourage people to think about how they could
contribute to that effort. If there are more people paying attention
to the software, Commons components will have higher quality, more
bug reports will be filed, and more people might take some time to
submit documentation patches. If you find Jakarta Commons (or any
other Apache software) useful, you should consider taking a little
bit of time to help a fellow user on the user mailing list or submit
documentation patches. If you find a typo or a bug, file a report on
Apache's Bugzilla installation (<systemitem role="url" moreinfo="none">http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla</systemitem>) or Jira
installation (<systemitem role="url" moreinfo="none">http://issues.apache.org/jira</systemitem>).</para>
         <para>There is always a need for greater unit test coverage, and any time
you find an inconsistency in code you should file a bug.
Contributions can come in many forms — answering user
questions, writing documentation, writing unit tests, submitting
patches, or providing feedback. All of these contributions help
sustain a living community. If you find yourself unable to
participate in the community, you can make a small (possibly
tax-deductible) donation to the Apache Software Foundation to help
offset the cost of infrastructure and bandwidth (<systemitem role="url" moreinfo="none">http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html</systemitem>).</para>

         <title>The Apache Software License</title>
         <para>Everything in this book is covered by the Apache Software License 2.0
(except FreeMarker, which is covered by a similar BSD-style license).
All developers who touch open source should be familiar with the
various licenses and come to their own conclusions; most importantly,
you should become familiar with the Apache license (and other
BSD-style licenses) and how it differs from the GNU General Public
License (GPL) and GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Read the
Apache Software License 2.0 at <systemitem role="url" moreinfo="none">http://www.apache.org/licenses/</systemitem>.</para>
         <para>I am not a lawyer (IANAL), but I would urge you to learn as much as
you can about these licenses before you start to use them. For more
information about open source, and for a comprehensive list of
licenses, see the Open Source Initiative (OSI) at <systemitem role="url" moreinfo="none">http://www.opensource.org</systemitem>. The Apache license
does not place restrictions on people or organizations that wish to
redistribute the software it covers, and, in general, the Apache
license creates fewer licensing headaches for individuals and
organizations that want to incorporate open source software into a
commercial product.</para>
