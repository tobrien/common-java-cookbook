    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Systems designed without clear separation between presentation and
    application logic quickly become chores to maintain. Trivial look-and-feel
    updates in such applications take days or weeks, and trying to extend such
    a coupled architecture can introduce unmanageable risks and code that is
    impossible to unit test. To minimize the possibility of creating such
    disasters, avoid coupling presentation and application logic through the
    use of a good templating engine. Maintain clear separation between
    presentation and application logic from the beginning—be orthogonal. Don't
    print out HTML, XML, or SQL from Java code, use a templating
    engine.</para>

    <para>The simplest example of templating is Java's <literal
    moreinfo="none">MessageFormat</literal>. A simple message, such as
    <literal moreinfo="none">Hello {0}, I speak {1}</literal>, can be
    parameterized using the <literal moreinfo="none">MessageFormat</literal>
    class. A more complex templating example is found in applications that use
    Jakarta Velocity or FreeMarker to avoid mixing Java with HTML or textual
    output. Throughout this spectrum of complexity, the concept of templating
    remains the same; a template with references to variables is merged with a
    context containing these variables. There are many ways to decouple the
    rigors of logic from the prettiness of presentation, and after reading
    this chapter, you will have a range of options for different
    situations.</para>

    <para>This chapter touches upon Jakarta Velocity, Jakarta Commons JEXL,
    and a technology outside of the Apache Software Foundation named
    FreeMarker. Templating engines are frequently used in web application, and
    this chapter ends with instructions for integrating these engines into a
    J2EE web application. Separating HTML or textual content into a separate
    file allows you to give graphic designers and business users a larger role
    in customizing and creating content for the enduser. With a templating
    engine, you can dramatically reduce the time and effort it takes to make
    simple changes. But, by far, the largest benefit of a templating engine is
    that it allows programmers to do more programming and graphic designers to
    do more designing by reducing needless coupling of presentation markup and
    compiled application logic.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Common Templating Problems in Applications</title>

      <para>Server-side Java has won a fair amount of attention over the past
      five years, but developers seldom consider using templating engines when
      writing a standalone Java application. Consider the following code,
      which prints a formatted report for a bank customer:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" id="I_9_tt350">System.out.println( "******************************" );
System.out.println( "******* BANK STATEMENT *******" );
System.out.println( "******************************" );
Account[] accounts = AccountUtil.getAccounts("1232");
double total = 0.0;
for( int i = 0; i &lt; accounts.length; i++ ) {
    System.out.println( "Account: " + 
        accounts[i].getBalance( ) );
    total += accounts[i].getBalance( ); 
}
System.out.println( "Total: " + total );
System.out.println( "******************************" );</programlisting>

      <para>In this example, textual content is mixed with Java code, and a
      programmer must be involved in any change to the look and feel of the
      report. If this report were generated using an external template, a
      nonprogrammer could be trained to change the report, or the customers
      could customize the output of this program by modifying a template with
      straightforward syntax.</para>

      <para>Consider another common problem: generating an XML document. There
      are seemingly thousands of ways to create an XML document: using DOM or
      JDOM to create a <literal moreinfo="none">Document</literal> object,
      serializing an object with Jakarta Commons Betwixt, and using Exolab's
      Castor are a few of these possibilities. Some of these techniques are
      explained in <link linkend="xml">Chapter 6</link>, but
      here is an example of how <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> to
      generate an XML document:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" id="I_9_tt351">System.out.println("&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;");
System.out.println("&lt;Config&gt;");
System.out.println("&lt;Property name=\"" + name + "\"\n" +
                   "value=\"" + value + "\"/&gt;");
System.out.println("&lt;/Config&gt;");</programlisting>

      <para>Avoid this practice at all costs. Here are a few red flags from
      the previous two examples:</para>

          <term>Mixed languages</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Nesting an XML document into a Java class by way of printing
            out <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> literals is
            unreadable. When you need to mentally decode heavily escaped XML
            nested in Java, you are asking yourself to do too much at once.
            You will also end up with mixed context, an XML element starting
            within a pair of parentheses, and ending in another. In this fugue
            of forward and back slashes, one misplaced slash produces an
            invalid XML document, or one overlooked <literal
            moreinfo="none">NullPointerException</literal> causes a
            catastrophe. You are asking your brain to compile two strands of
            code with intertwined and overlapping syntax. While your compiler
            might not complain, your system will be difficult to maintain.
            Code that is difficult to comprehend is even more difficult to
            maintain.</para>

          <term>Escaped characters in compiled code</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Escaping characters in <literal
            moreinfo="none">String</literal> literals quickly becomes an
            annoyance, especially if the strings to be encoded contain back
            slashes and double quotes. I accept that the <literal
            moreinfo="none">String</literal> <filename
            moreinfo="none">c:\temp\blah.txt</filename>, must be written as
            <literal moreinfo="none">c:\\temp\\blah.txt</literal>, but I don't
            enjoy doing it. How confusing is a literal <literal
            moreinfo="none">\"c:\\temp\\\</literal>"? Avoid this entirely by
            using a templating engine or externalizing strings in properties
            files.</para>

          <term>Mixing presentation with conditional or iterative logic</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>A previous example printed each account balance in a
            <literal moreinfo="none">for</literal> loop. A common trick in JSP
            is to create a <literal moreinfo="none">while</literal> loop with
            JSP scriptlets, surrounding the code to be executed with <literal
            moreinfo="none">&lt;% while( i &lt; 4 ) { %&gt;</literal> and
            <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;% } %&gt;</literal>. Templating
            languages such as Velocity or even JSP 2.0 with JSTL support
            conditional and iterative operations without asking you to mix
            languages.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>There are other opportunities for using a template in an
      application. These include code generation, creating SQL scripts, and
      interacting with an interpreted language via generated scripts. The list
      continues, and it proves that templating isn't just for making web
      pages.</para>

        <para>This is real code from a real system, and it was written by a
        whole team of programmers who didn't find anything terribly wrong with
        this style. If you were raised on JSP like this, you might not
        recognize some of the problems. What is wrong with the previous
        example? Four different "languages" are combined in one file (Java,
        SQL, HTML, and JSP); the page starts off with JSP scriptlets, then the
        example contains Java code that prints out HTML and generates SQL
        statements. Lastly, this particular JSP page forgets to close the
        connection it created to the database—something that could easily
        create a resource leak under a heavy load. Make it simpler, use a
        templating engine (or upgrade to JSP 2.0) and <emphasis

      <para>Velocity, JEXL, and FreeMarker are remedies for the coupling
      issues demonstrated in the previous examples. Each of these tools can be
      integrated into any application in a matter of minutes. In this chapter,
      you will learn techniques for separating presentation logic from
      behavioral (or business) logic. At the end of the chapter, I will
      briefly explain how you can integrate all of these utilities into a J2EE

      <para>Use Commons JEXL to evaluate an expression containing references

      expression using the bean property syntax introduced in <link
      linkend="beans">Chapter 3</link>. Surround each property
      reference with curly braces and a leading <literal

      <para>Use the following code to "merge" an instance of the <literal

Opera opera = new Opera( );
opera.setName("The Magic Flute");
opera.setComposer("Mozart");
opera.setYear(1791);

String expr =

      <para>This code puts an instance of the <literal

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Discussion</title>

      <para>The previous example creates and populates an instance of the
      <literal moreinfo="none">Opera</literal> bean: <literal
      moreinfo="none">opera</literal>. An <literal
      moreinfo="none">Expression</literal> object is then created by passing a
      <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> containing a JEXL expression
      to <literal moreinfo="none">ExpressionFactory.createExpression(
      )</literal>. A <literal moreinfo="none">JexlContext</literal> is created
      with a call to <literal moreinfo="none">JexlHelper.createContext(
      )</literal>. This context contains a map-like structure that holds named
      variables, and the <literal moreinfo="none">Opera</literal> object is
      added to the <literal moreinfo="none">JexlContext</literal> under the
      name <literal moreinfo="none">opera</literal>. Once an <literal
      moreinfo="none">Expression</literal> and a <literal
      moreinfo="none">JexlContext</literal> are created and populated,
      <literal moreinfo="none">expression.evaluate( )</literal> merges the
      expression with the context, and a message is generated. A JEXL
      expression evaluates to an <literal moreinfo="none">Object</literal>,
      but, in this case, the expression evaluates to a <literal
      moreinfo="none">String</literal> object, and the results of the
      evaluation are cast to a <literal
      moreinfo="none">String</literal>.</para>

      <para>This simple example sets the stage for a majority of recipes in
      this chapter; most templating engines involve the pattern established by
      the previous example. First, there is a template—in this case, a
      <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> that contains expressions that
      are to be replaced by bean properties. Second, a collection of named
      variables are put into a context. Lastly, the template is merged with
      the variables in the context.</para>

      <para>This chapter makes heavy use of expressions in templating engines,
      and this is a logical time to introduce the concept of the syntax used
      to create expressions. If you are familiar with <indexterm

          <primary>storage, expressions</primary>
        </indexterm>expressions used in an application. For this recipe,
      imagine yourself creating a system to sort <literal
      moreinfo="none">Ball</literal> objects based on a set of arbitrary
      criteria. Instead of hard-coding criteria in a series of Java <literal
      moreinfo="none">if</literal>-<literal moreinfo="none">else</literal>
      clauses, create a framework with loads sorting criteria from a
      properties file containing <literal moreinfo="none">boolean</literal>
      JEXL expressions. For instance, the first line in this properties file
      would be:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" id="I_9_tt360">Hvy-Green-Basket = ball.color == 'Green' &amp;&amp; (ball.weight &gt; 1000)</programlisting>

      <para>This translates to "If the ball's color is Green and the weight is
      over 1000, put this ball into the Heavy Green basket." The name of each
      property is the name of the basket into which a <literal
      moreinfo="none">Ball</literal> matching the criteria is placed. The
      contents of the criteria file are:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" id="I_9_tt361">Hvy-Green-Basket = ball.color == 'Green' &amp;&amp; (ball.weight &gt; 1000)
Sm-Yellow-bin = ball.color == 'Yellow' &amp;&amp; (ball.weight &lt; 100)
Transparent-Bin = ball.isTransparent( )
Lrg-Yellow-Basket = ball.color == 'Yellow' &amp;&amp;(ball.weight &gt;= 100)
Misc-Bin = true</programlisting>

      <para>Each criterion is applied to each <literal
      moreinfo="none">Ball</literal> object in the order it appears in the
      criteria file. The heavy green sorting criteria is applied first, and
      each criterion is evaluated until the last criterion is reached. The
      last criteria always evaluates to <literal
      moreinfo="none">true</literal>—similar to a <literal
      moreinfo="none">switch</literal>-<literal moreinfo="none">case</literal>
      control statement, the "Misc-bin" is the default. The following code
      reads this criteria file and evaluates each JEXL expression in order to
      sort a collection of <literal moreinfo="none">Ball</literal>
      objects:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" id="I_9_tt362">import org.apache.commons.jexl.Expression;

// Load in our criteria properties
Properties criteria = new Properties( );
criteria.load( getClass( ).getResourceAsStream("criteria.txt") );

// Load our ball objects into a List
List balls = getBalls( );

    // Iterate through every rule, until you find a match...
    Iterator binIter = binName.iterator( );
    while( ruleIter.hasNext( ) ) {
        
        // Get the name of the basket
        String basket = (String) binIter.next( );

        // Get the expression corresponding to this bin.
        String expr = conditions.get( bin );
        Expression e = ExpressionFactory.createExpression( expr );          

        // Populate the context with the current Ball object
        JexlContext jc = JexlHelper.createContext( );
        jc.getVars( ).put("ball", ball);
        
        // Evaluate the Expression.
        Boolean result = (Boolean) e.evaluate(jc);
        
        // If the expression evaluated to true, add this Ball to the bin.
        if( result.booleanValue( ) == true ) {
            sendBall( ball, basket );
        }
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>The result of the <literal moreinfo="none">Expression</literal>
      evaluation is a <literal moreinfo="none">Boolean</literal> <indexterm

      <title>Discussion</title>

      <para>Using this technique, as the number of criteria increases, the
      code to implement this sorting algorithm remains unchanged. The behavior
      of the system can be altered by changing the criteria file; compiled
      code is left untouched. The code in this Solution section is longer than
      a series of <literal moreinfo="none">if</literal>-<literal
      moreinfo="none">else</literal> clauses to implement these criteria in
      code, but, as the number of sorting criteria increases, you will be glad
      you took the extra time to create a general solution without hard coding
      system behavior in Java code.</para>

      <para>This was the first example that involved something more than
      printing out a pretty message for human consumption. JEXL has been used
      to create a "language" for sorting criteria; if a client wants to change
      the rules, you can now train someone familiar with simple logic
      statements to change a system to meet changing requirements.</para>

      <para>Use Jakarta Velocity and store your template in the filesystem.
      Jakarta Velocity is a straightforward templating engine with a

      <link linkend="templating-SECT-2">Recipe 9.2</link>. The
      following Velocity template is used to create an email:</para>

      moreinfo="none">magazine</literal> property, and both of these
      properties are assigned to a local template variable using the <literal

      To successfully render this Velocity template, verify that an <literal
      moreinfo="none">Address</literal> is sent to the <literal
      moreinfo="none">#address</literal> macro and a <literal
      moreinfo="none">Person</literal> is sent to the <literal

      <para>In the previous example, an instance of <literal

      Velocity has built-in resource loaders to load resources from the

      configuration configures two resource loaders for a <literal
      moreinfo="none">VelocityEngine</literal>—a filesystem resource loader
      and a classpath resource loader. When a resource is loaded, the <literal
      moreinfo="none">VelocityEngine</literal> attempts to locate the resource
      in the filesystem, and, if the resource is not found, it searches the
      classpath. Using this configuration, you can create an application with
      default templates in the classpath, which can be overridden by
      customized templates on the filesystem. The file resource loader is also
      configured to cache file resources in memory, checking for a
      modification every 600 seconds:</para>

      <title>Problem</title>

      <para>You need to find a templating engine that supports number
      formatting, date formatting, and comparison of double values. In
      addition, you are looking for a templating engine that gives you more
      control over whitespace and line breaks.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Solution</title>

      <para>Use FreeMarker, a templating engine with a large built-in feature
      set that includes support for date and number formatting and intelligent
      handling of whitespace. The following FreeMarker template creates a
      summary report for a college course:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" id="I_9_tt387">&lt;#assign student = enrollment.student &gt;
&lt;#assign course = enrollment.course &gt;
&lt;#assign exams = enrollment.exams &gt;
&lt;#-- This macro assigns a variable named final --&gt;
&lt;@final exams=exams/&gt;    

${student.firstName} ${student.lastName},

Here is a summary of your performance in ${course.dept} ${course.num}

      <para>In the template for this recipe, three objects are retrieved from
      an <literal moreinfo="none">Enrollment</literal> object: a <literal
      moreinfo="none">course</literal> property, a <literal
      moreinfo="none">student</literal> property, and a <literal
      moreinfo="none">List</literal> of <literal
      moreinfo="none">Exam</literal> objects. Three variables—<literal
      moreinfo="none">course</literal>, <literal
      moreinfo="none">student</literal>, and <literal
      moreinfo="none">exam</literal>—are created with the <literal

      moreinfo="none">&lt;#assign</literal> <literal moreinfo="none">variable
      = expression &gt;</literal>. Properties are referenced as they were
      referenced in JEXL and Velocity; <literal
      moreinfo="none">${enrollment.student}</literal> is used to access the
      <literal moreinfo="none">student</literal> property on the <literal
      moreinfo="none">enrollment</literal>. A student's final course grade is
      calculated in a macro by calling <literal
      moreinfo="none">&lt;@final</literal> <literal
      moreinfo="none">exams=exams/&gt;</literal>. This macro assigns a global
      template variable, <literal moreinfo="none">final</literal>, which is
      formatted to one decimal place with the expression <literal
      moreinfo="none">${final; m1M1}</literal>.</para>

      <para>At first glance, a FreeMarker template looks very similar to a
      Velocity template, but there are several interesting features not
      available in Velocity:</para>

            the day, month, and year portion of the date, and <literal
            moreinfo="none">?string.short</literal> tells FreeMarker to use
            the locale's short-date format (12/31/04). You can also specify
            your own date format using the same syntax you would use in
            <literal moreinfo="none">SimpleDateFormat</literal>. The
            expression <literal moreinfo="none">${exam.date?string("MM-dd-yyyy
            hh:mm:ss")}</literal> would output a string similar to "12-31-2004

      <tip id="templating-NOTE-67" role="ora">
        <para>Velocity has a very large user base, and it is the right tool
        for a simple job. FreeMarker has some very useful features "out of the
        box," while Velocity requires developers to install supporting
        utilities or write these "extensions" from scratch. Some developers
        will prefer a templating language that is simple by design, and others
        need a tool that is substantially more complex. There is a case to be
        made for simplicity. If you working on a large team, where you have
        content authors who need to create and maintain your templates, you
        may want to use a technology like Velocity that embraces simplicity.
        Open source communities benefit from healthy cross-pollination of
        ideas and competition, and FreeMarker was developed as an alternative
        to Jakarta Velocity; they even have a feature comparison page
        (<systemitem moreinfo="none"

      <para>Use FreeMarker and parse an XML document with the <literal
      moreinfo="none">NodeModel</literal> class. A <literal
      moreinfo="none">NodeModel</literal> is an object that allows access to
      an XML document as a hierarchy of named elements and attributes from a
      FreeMarker template. <literal moreinfo="none">NodeModel</literal> has a
      <literal moreinfo="none">public</literal> <literal
      moreinfo="none">static</literal> method <literal moreinfo="none">parse(

      moreinfo="none">someMap["key"]</literal>, you would use <literal
      moreinfo="none">someElement["&lt;XPath&gt;"]</literal>. Here is a quick

    <title>Using Velocity in a Web Application</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Problem</title>

      <para>You are sick of writing JSP and having to wait for pages to
      compile. You would like to find a way to use Velocity instead of
      JSP.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Solution</title>

      <para>Configure your web application to use the <literal
      moreinfo="none">VelocityViewServlet</literal> to render your Velocity
      templates. Download the latest version of the <literal
      moreinfo="none">VelocityView</literal> project from <systemitem
      moreinfo="none"
      role="url">http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.cgi</systemitem>; it
      is listed under "Velocity Tools 1.1." Put the velocity and
      velocity-tools jars in the <filename
      moreinfo="none">WEB-INF/lib</filename> directory, and configure your web
      application to render templates ending in <filename
      moreinfo="none">*.vm</filename> with the <literal
      moreinfo="none">VelocityViewServlet</literal>. Add the following
      <literal moreinfo="none">servlet</literal> and <literal
      moreinfo="none">servlet-mapping</literal> elements to your <filename
      moreinfo="none">web.xml</filename> file as follows:</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific" id="I_9_tt394">&lt;!-- Define Velocity template compiler --&gt;
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;velocity&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;
    org.apache.velocity.tools.view.servlet.VelocityViewServlet
  &lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;load-on-startup&gt;10&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;

.....other servlets.....

&lt;!-- Map *.vm files to Velocity --&gt;
&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;velocity&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.vm&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>All requests ending in <filename moreinfo="none">*.vm</filename>
      are processed by the <literal
      moreinfo="none">VelocityViewServlet</literal>, which locates the
      appropriate Velocity template in the document root of your web
      application. Attributes from the request, session, and application scope
      will be available as variables in the <literal
      moreinfo="none">VelocityContext</literal>.</para>

      <para>To test this configuration, create a simple Velocity template in
      the document root of your web application named <filename
      moreinfo="none">index.vm</filename>, start your servlet container, and
      attempt to render the template by loading <systemitem moreinfo="none"
      role="url">http://&lt;server&gt;/&lt;web-app&gt;/index.vm</systemitem>
      in a browser. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the
      rendered template. If the configuration is not correct, you will see the
      source for your Velocity template.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Discussion</title>

      <para>JSP compilation is an annoyance, especially if you are constantly
      altering and debugging JSP—all that waiting around adds up over the
      course of a long project. Using Velocity can help improve performance;
      the simplicity and elegance of Velocity makes parsing and executing a
      template fast and efficient. If you are looking for a viable alternative
      to JSP, try Velocity as your view layer, and you might be
      surprised.</para>

      <para>Velocity can be a refreshing break from JSP, and almost any web
      application framework will work with Velocity. If you are working with
      an existing web application, there is no need to stop using JSP in lieu
      of Velocity; you can use both technologies in the same web application.
      Templates ending in <filename moreinfo="none">*.jsp</filename> will be
      rendered by the existing JSP servlet, and templates ending in <filename
      moreinfo="none">*.vm</filename> will be rendered by the <literal
      moreinfo="none">VelocityViewServlet</literal>.</para>
