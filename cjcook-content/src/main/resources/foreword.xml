  <para>May 17, 2009 - I've had some great feedback after putting the book up
  on the web site, in the last week, I've open sourced the book, and I'll be
  slowly upgrading the book project infrastructure. Again, stay tuned.</para>

  <para>Edition: ${project.version}</para>

  <para><emphasis>February 20, 2009 - </emphasis>This is an early version of
  the second edition of Jakarta Commons Cookbook. I'm updating the content,
  and you might experience some problems with links between chapters and
  sections. Don't rely on any of the URLs in this book just yet, I'm currently
  renaming all of the sections and chapters so that every section has a
  reasonable URL. I'm also trying to find some interesting ways to link to
  related O'Reilly content using the new O'Reilly metadata interface that was
  just published by O'Reilly Labs. Stay Tuned.</para>
